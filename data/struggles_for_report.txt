Made ample use of RegEx for scraping and formatting of retrieved data from scrapes

Issues/Struggles:

	When scraping Apartments.com 
		requests was unresponsive for this website, therefore I was required to use selenium for this scrape
		price listings were often given as a price range, to handle this I averaged the lower and upper bounds later before 

	When merging
		had to learn to utilize pivot tables for getting average prices per zipcode
